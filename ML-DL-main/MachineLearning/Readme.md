## Titanic Dataset Prediction
I made a model for titanic dataset where it can predict whether the people died or alive based on the dataset features.

Following things have been done in this model :-

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Visualization
4. Machine learning Model Training
5. Model Evaluation
